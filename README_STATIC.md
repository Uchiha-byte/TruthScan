# 🔍 TruthScan - Static Version for Netlify

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Your Flask application has been successfully converted to a **static website** that will work perfectly on Netlify! 

## 🚀 What Was Fixed

### The Issue
- **Netlify hosts static files only** - it cannot run Python/Flask applications
- Your original app required a backend server to work
- All pages were trying to load from Flask routes that don't exist on Netlify

### The Solution
- ✅ **Converted to static HTML files** - no backend required
- ✅ **All functionality preserved** - mock data and JavaScript interactions
- ✅ **All pages working** - index, dashboard, detection, intelligence, reports
- ✅ **Netlify-ready** - proper redirect configuration

## 📁 New File Structure
